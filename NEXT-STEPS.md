- add in references to json-server for the fake db. 
- add a reminder (refer to fsophonebook project) when the json-server isn't running, put the dev server startup code in here. 
- mock up the UI a bit better. lookup on the left, active writing panel on the right. Maybe change states between card referent / writing panel in each section?
